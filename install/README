Installation Details
------------ -------

This is file {Xinu-directory}/install/README.  It contains
instructions for installing the Xinu software and recompiling
it.  These instructions instructions must be followed:
(a) after the distribution tape has been read in, or
(b) after the Xinu directory has been moved.

*** NOTE: if you are still running 4.2bsd, you must remove ***
*** all the 4.3 files and libraries before doing anything  ***
*** else.  To do so, type the following:                   ***

Installation involves changing references to {Xinu-directory}
in all source files and then recompiling them.

Step 1:	Execute shell script "Install" in this directory
	to climb around the tree and create final versions
	of the source files.  Look at the file sample.output
	to see what to expect.

		cd {Xinu-directory}/install
		./Install

Step 2:	Change to the file server directory and install the
	new versions:

		cd {Xinu-directory}/fs
		make install

	You do not need to be superuser; only directories
	under {Xinu-directory} are affected. 

Step 3:	Install the Stanford SUMacC cross compiler.  The makefiles
	in {Xinu-directory}/gateway expect the compiler to be in
	/usr/stanford/bin.

Step 4:	Follow the installation instructions that come with the
	Kinetics FastPath gateway to install the software in
	{Xinu-directory}/gateway/src.

Step 5:	Once the VAX software is installed, you can run the test
	version of Macintosh XINU on the Macintosh in directory
	/XINU/sys/sys.  See the README file on the Macintosh in
	directory /XINU.

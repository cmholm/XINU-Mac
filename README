# XINU-Mac
The Macintosh 68k port of the Xinu operating system, originally released in 1989.

MacXINU is used just as any other pre-OS X Macintosh application; it can be double-clicked from the Macintosh Finder or invoked by name from the Aztec [compiler] shell. Unlike NetBSD/mac68k, it does not load a new kernel in place of the classic MacOS. XINU runs on 512K Macintoshes with old or new ROMs and on Mac Plusses [and, I suspect, on a Mac SE].  It will not run on a 128K Macintosh, because it does not have enough memory.  It does not yet run on a Macintosh II.

The original build environment was the Macintosh-native release of Aztec C. As of 2024, this version of the compiler is as rare as hen's teeth, and unavailable on the Aztec and classic Macintosh software repositories that I'm aware of. As a result, this code will likely need to be massaged for use with more readily available copies of CodeWarrior, Lightspeed/Think, MPW, or Retro68 C.

   Xinu is a layered, process-based operating system.  A detailed
description can be found in the text:

	Comer, Douglas E., Operating System Design: The Xinu
	  Approach, Prentice-Hall, 1984.

This directory contains version 7 of the VAX software required to
support Macintosh XINU, part of which is described in chapter 13 of:

	Comer, Douglas E., Operating System Design Vol 2:
	  Internetworking with Xinu, Prentice-Hall, 1987.

To get the Macintosh XINU version 7 system software (from the second
volume) on two Macintosh diskettes, contact:

   To run the software on this tape, you will need a Digital Equipment
Corp. VAX or Microvax computer running the Berkeley 4.3 UNIX operating
system, the Stanford University Macintosh C compiler (SUMacC), and a
Kinetics FastPath AppleTalk/Ethernet gateway.  The VAX is used to cross-
compile, cross-assemble, and cross-load C programs to the gateway and to
run the XINU file server.
   The tape can be read into any directory.  These programs do not need
to be placed in system directories unless you want to do so.

Installation
------------

   Choose a directory for the Xinu software.  You need not be in this
directory to cross-compile or download programs -- it's merely the place
to store the Xinu software.  Moving the software to another directory
requires recompilation (i.e., reinstallation).  Choosing /usr/Xinu as
the directory will save time during installation because binary files on
the tape are compiled for that directory.  Alternatively, you can choose
to place the software in an arbitrary directory and make a symbolic link
from /usr/Xinu to that directory.  Throughout this  documentation the
directory into which you place Xinu is denoted {Xinu-directory}.

   Make the Xinu directory and read in the tape by typing the following
commands:

	mkdir {Xinu-directory}
	cd {Xinu-directory}
	tar xbf 20 /dev/rmt0	(your 1600 bpi tape device may
				 be named something other than
				 /dev/rmt0)

   Make a symbolic link from /usr/Xinu to the directory you chose to
avoid recompilation.  You will need super user privilege to do so. This
step is optional:

	su
	...supply super user password when asked...
	ln -s {Xinu-directory} /usr/Xinu
	CONTROL-d (to leave super user mode)

Once the tape has been read, you must change all source programs that
refer to {Xinu-directory} and recompile the binaries.  A shell script
has been provided to do this for you.  To use it, move to the installation
directory and run Install.  *NOTE: YOU MUST BE IN THE INSTALLATION DIRECTORY
{Xinu-directory}/install WHEN YOU EXECUTE THIS SCRIPT OR IT WILL NOT WORK*

	cd {Xinu-directory}/install
	./Install

Compilation of Cross-Development Software
----------- -- ----------------- --------

   To complete installation you must recompile source programs that contain
references to the Xinu directory.  For details, see file README in the installation directory:

	cd {Xinu-directory}/install
	cat README

Network Servers
------- -------

   Now that installation is complete, you need to Configure the Xinu
kernel software itself, and recompile it.  To do so, you must choose
internet addresses for the domain name server, time server, and remote
file server machines.  You can start the remote file server yourself
on the VAX.  It is found in {Xinu-directory}/bin/fs.  You need to know
the internet address of the VAX where fs runs, as well as the internet
address of the machine that runs a time server (UDP port 37) and the
internet address of a machine that runs a domain name server (UDP port
53).  Ask your local network guru to tell you these internet addresses
(in dotted decimal notation) and modify the SERVER constants found on
the Macintosh near the end of file /XINU/sys/sys/Configuration.  If you do
not have an assigned Internet address for your network (i.e., your network
does not connect to the DARPA Internet), choose a network address for it.
Using 128.10.2.0 (which is actually the address of an Ethernet at Purdue),
means you won't have to recompile the kernel.

Remote File Server
------ ---- ------

   The remote file server answers queries from the network and reads/writes
files as directed.  If you run the file server on your VAX, then the file
server has the permissions of the user who starts it.  We recommend that you
install a new user account (e.g., "xinu"), and always execute the file server
as that user.  Also, you should understand that the file server makes all
world-readable files accessible over the network.  If you connect to the
DARPA Internet, it makes world-readable files accessible from foreign sites.
   The file server comes configured to use UDP port 2001.  Check with
your local network guru to make sure 2001 is not in use, and if it is,
choose a new port number for the file server.  Change the default port
in the software in {Xinu-directory}/fs or just use the -p option when
invoking fs.  You must also change the port number that the kernel uses
- it can be found on the Macintosh in file /XINU/sys/sys/Configuration.
   Start the file server:

	...login to the VAX under the account that owns the file server...
	{Xinu-directory}/bin/fs
	logout

Try Running Xinu
--- ------- ----

   Now that you have a network running RARP, time, and name servers,
you can boot xinu.  Turn on the Macintosh, double-click on the SHELL,
and, in directory /XINU/sys/sys, type "macxinu".
   To recompile xinu, run make in /XINU/sys/sys.  Recompiling the whole
system from scratch, which will be necessary the first time, takes about
an hour.

# Appletalk administration database table (atalkatab),
# read by appletalk admin daemon (atalkad).
#
# When each kbox boots it asks atalkad for:  (1) its site specific 
# configuration information.  (2) the location of other kboxes
# and appletalk nets in this 'campus'.   This file is read when atalkad
# starts, and also if atalkatab is rewritten in place (write date
# changes.) 
#
# Atalkad normally just answers 'requests' for data from the kboxes,
# but if called with arguments ("atalkad route" or "atalkad boot"),
# atalkad will force new routing or config information to each kbox
# configured in this table.
#
# If a line in this file begins in column 1 (no leading tabs or spaces), it 
# describes an appletalk net ("anet") and its location, in this format:
#
# appletalk_net_number	flags	IP_address_or_name	zone_name
#
# The anet can be a simple number, or in 'dot notation', e.g. '12.34'
# which would place 12 in the high byte and 34 in the low byte of the
# 16 bit anet number.
#
# The flags field is a string of single letters denoting the type 
# of appletalk net:
#
#	K	Anet is the atalk port on a kbox, located at IP_address.
#	C	This kbox is also a 'core gateway'.  One or two
#		of the kboxes in a campus situation will be setup as cores
#		to minimize the packets required for route table updates.
#	N	Anet is equivalent to an IP net (usually ether) supporting
#		directed broadcast.
#	0,1,2,3	For flag N, this number selects the format of the broadcast
#		address used:  either 0, 1, 2, or 3 0xFF (255) suffix
#		bytes on the IP_address.
#	H	Anet is an IP net, but it doesnt support directed broadcasts,
#		so IP_address is the address of a host on that net (can be
#		a kbox) running a 'rebroadcast' server.
#
# If a line in this file begins with spaces or tabs, then it contains
# 'configuration information' for the kbox described on the previous line.
# There may be as many of these lines as are required to describe the
# config.  Each line can contain one or more fields, the fields represent
# numbers or strings that are loaded into the gateway at boot time.
# The first character of each field denotes the type of information:
#
#	I	A four byte IP address or name
#	L	A four byte 'long' numeric value.  Assumed decimal but
#		can be prefixed by an X or H to denote hex.
#	S	A two byte 'short' (can also be in dot notation).
#	C	A one byte 'char'.
#	"..."	An ascii string.
#
# The fields are packed into the config structure as presented, the 
# daemon does no type or validity checking other than that mentioned above.

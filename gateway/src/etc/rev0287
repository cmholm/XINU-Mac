Below is a list of (mostly minor) bugs fixed in the 0287 release.

kip/gw.c/iematch(), abmatch();		unsigned compares failing
	The range checks for ARP matching on the IP dynamic addresses
	are failing sometimes due to unsigned compare wraparound.
	New code rewrites these functions to avoid unsigned compares.
	Since Stanford has a class A address, we didnt uncover this
	until class B and C sites started using the code.
	[reported by mckay@ee.ecn.purdue.edu, hemphill@nrl-aic, etc.]

kip/gw.c,gw2.c/;		hop counts in ddp header
	The DDP hop count is now incremented and masked off properly
	when looking at the ddp.length field.
	[reported by kre (Robert Elz)]

kip/rtmp.c/artinput();		allow arbitrary format broadcast addresses
	The old code made assumptions about the route table entry for
	the directly attached ether cable.  The new code allows this to
	be set instead from the atalkad.
	[reported by mckay@ee.ecn.purdue.edu, dk1z#@andrew.cmu.edu, etc.]

kip/gw.c/routeddp();		route failure with interbridge
	An extraneous routing loopback check was discarding appletalk
	packets with src&dst on the same cable.  Check removed.
	[reported by gcc-milo!brad]

kip/etc/atalkad.c;		4.3 BSD function name conflict
	Rename the atalkad.c function getshort() to be getashort().
	4.3 domain name server library already has a function
	called getshort().

kip/etc/atalkad.c;		zero zone name field
	Since zone name field length may change upon a reread of 
	atalkatab, that field should be zeroed in the structure passed
	to the kboxes.
	[reported by gcc-milo!brad]

kip/etc/atalkad.c;		(month/date) in atalkalog
	January is being reported as month number zero(!)

cap/samples/papif.c		assumes special lpd
	Papif assumes that lpd has been modified to pass the printer
	name to the filter with the '-p' switch.  To avoid this dependency
	a trivial shell file can be setup that execs in papif with the
	proper -p switch along with the previous arguments.

kip/etc/broadcast
	New documentation that better explains IP broadcasting issues.
